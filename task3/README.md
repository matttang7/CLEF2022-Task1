# Multi-Class Fake News Detection of News Articles

Multi-class fake news detection of news articles (English): Sub-task A would be the detection of fake news designed as a four-class classification problem. The training data will be released in batches and will be roughly about 900 articles with the respective label. Given the text of a news article, determine whether the main claim made in the article is true, partially true, false, or other.

### Cross-Lingual Task

Along with the multi-class task for the English language, we have introduced a task for low resourced language. We will provide the data for dev and test in the German language. The idea of the task is to use the English data and the concept of transfer to build a classification model for the German language.
